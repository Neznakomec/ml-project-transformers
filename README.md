Proposal:
[PROJECT PROPOSAL.pdf](https://github.com/Neznakomec/ml-project-transformers/blob/main/PROJECT%20PROPOSAL.pdf)

Project goals:

1. Try to reproduce image captioning NN model.

2. Train the model on different datasets.

3. Measure results on different metrics, suggested in paper (starting from BLEU score metric, and diving into what other metrics they used)
